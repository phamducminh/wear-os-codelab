Wear OS Ongoing Activity API Code Lab Repository
================================================
An **Ongoing** Activity is a new feature in Wear OS that allows an **Ongoing Notification** to
appear on additional surfaces within the Wear OS user interface which allows users to stay more
engaged with long running activities.

**Ongoing Notifications** are typically used to indicate a Notification has a background task that the
user is actively engaged with (for example, playing music) or is pending in some way and therefore
occupying the device (for example, a file download, sync operation, or an active network
connection).

This repository is to be used in conjunction with the
[Wear OS Ongoing Activity API Code Lab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/ongoing-activity).
