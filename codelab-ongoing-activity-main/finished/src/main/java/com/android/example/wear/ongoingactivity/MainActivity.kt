/**
 * The app's main purpose is to teach developers how to use Wear's Ongoing Activity API via the
 * @see <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/ongoing-activity/">
 * Wear Ongoing Activity Code Lab</a>.
 *
 * An Ongoing Activity allows an Ongoing Notification to appear on more Wear surfaces, for example,
 * the activity indicator on the watch face or Recent apps in the app launcher. Users can then
 * easily re-enter the app through a simple tap from those surfaces.
 *
 * Ongoing Notifications are typically used to indicate a Notification has a background task that
 * the user is actively engaged with (e.g., playing music) or is pending in some way and therefore
 * occupying the device (e.g., a file download, sync operation, active network connection).
 *
 * For this app, we will use the Ongoing Notification to continue gathering (mock) sensor/location
 * data if the user navigates away from this Activity during an active walking workout.
 *
 * This Activity allows a user to start and stop a walking workout and earn "walking points" from
 * the UI. The actual work to start and stop a walking workout is done in the
 * [ForegroundOnlyWalkingWorkoutService] this Activity binds to. That Service creates the
 * walking points from mock location and sensor data.
 *
 * When a workout is active and the user navigates away from this Activity, that bound service is
 * promoted to a Foreground Service and tied to an Ongoing Notification, so the user can continue to
 * receive updates and this app can continue to gather location and sensor data to calculate
 * "walking points".
 *
 * By the end of this code lab, you will have exposed the same data from the Notification to new
 * surfaces when the user navigates away from an active workout from this Activity.
 *
 * NOTE: You should generally prefer 'while-in-use' for location updates, i.e., receiving
 * location updates while the app is in use and create a foreground service (tied to a Notification)
 * when the user navigates away from the app. This is why we are using this approach in this code
 * lab. For more information, review the
 * @see <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/location">location guides</a>.
